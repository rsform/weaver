# Terms of Service

*Last updated: December 2025*

These terms are a preliminary placeholder and will be updated before public beta release.

## Use at Your Own Risk

Weaver is currently in alpha. Features will change, there are bugs, and data loss is possible.

## Content

You are responsible for the content you publish through Weaver. Content is stored on AT Protocol Personal Data Servers according to those servers' terms of service, though it is temporarily cached on Weaver's server. A persistent index and cache will be added in the near future. This will respect deletion requests as much as is reasonable, and in complicance with regulations and laws local to the user (e.g. the EU "right to be forgotten"). Weaver as is can be used to view any compatible public atproto data if it exists, in its raw form. It will not decode or display in a human-readable format the contents of drafts you do not have edit rights for.

Weaver is developed and hosted in Canada and is subject to its laws regarding copyright, obscenity, etc. We are fans of freedom of expression, but we can and will refuse to serve content that puts us at substantial legal risk. In the interests of clarity, Canada has some specific laws around drawings or animations depicting minors in a sexually explicit way that we have no interest in testing. 

## No Warranty

This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
