# About Weaver

Weaver is a decentralized platform for people to write, collaborate, and share their writing with others. It is built on the AT Protocol that powers the Bluesky social network, allowing you to truly own what you make without having to run your own website.

Weaver currently works at the level of "entries" which can be collated into "notebooks". Additional groupings are planned (pages that group short entries, chapters, etc.), but those are the two essential ones. It uses Markdown as its format of choice, rendered beautifully.

## Current Features

- Extended Markdown with wikilinks, embedded content, and math support.
- Obsidian-style hybrid editor that is easy to use
- Real-time or asynchronous collaboration between users on notebook entries
- Themeable notebooks (not directly accessible in the UI yet)
- User profiles (also not directly accessible in the UI yet, interoperability with Bluesky and Tangled profiles)

## Planned Features

- Comprehensive suite of social and discovery features
  - User tagging and lists
  - Subscriptions and notifications (user, notebook, or tag-level)
- Private drafts and publishing (off-protocol until atproto officially supports private on-protocol data)
  - Technically the former already exists, but affordances are bad
- Integration of payment platforms

# A personal note from the creator

I'm a writer and a musician as well as an engineer. 

If you want to read more about the motivation behind Weaver, read [this](https://alpha.weaver.sh/did:plc:yfvwmnlztr4dwkb7hwz55r2g/weaver/weaver_-_long-form_writing), my first public writing about and on the platform. Weaver exists in part because I was unsatisfied with the other platforms available for me to write on. I'm betting on not being the only one looking for something better, and so I decided to take on the challenge of doing just that, for myself and because I felt like nobody else was well-positioned to, as writing ability and engineering ability are not strongly correlated skillsets. 

An ongoing series of development logs lives in [this notebook](https://alpha.weaver.sh/did:plc:yfvwmnlztr4dwkb7hwz55r2g/weaver/). All of the writing I've done here is available at my [profile page](https://alpha.weaver.sh/did:plc:yfvwmnlztr4dwkb7hwz55r2g/). 

Weaver is still very much a work in progress, and I consider it in an **alpha** state of completion. There is much that is incomplete, but it is usable as a writing platfom, though at times buggy. I would love for you to try it out, and if you run into problems, particularly with the editor, would welcome your feedback.
