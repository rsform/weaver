I grew up, like a lot of people on Bluesky, in the era of the internet where most of your online social interactions took place via text. I had a MySpace account, MSN messenger and Google Chat, I first got on Facebook back when they required a school email to sign up, I had a Tumblr, though not a LiveJournal. I was super into reddit for a long time. Big fan of Fanfiction.net and later Archive of Our Own.

Social media in the conventional sense has been in a lot of ways a small part of the story of my time on the internet. Because while I wasn't huge into independent internet forums, the broader independent blogosphere of my teens and early adulthood shaped my worldview, and I was an avid reader and sometime participant there. I am an atheist in large part because of a blog called [Common Sense Atheism](http://commonsenseatheism.com) (which I started reading in part because the author, Luke Muehlhauser, was criticising both Richard Dawkins and some Christian apologetics I was familiar with). Luke's blog was part of cluster of blogs out of which grew the [rationalists](https://www.lesswrong.com/), one of, for better or for worse, the most influential intellectual movements of the 21st century, who are, via people like [Scott ](https://slatestarcodex.com/) [Alexander](https://www.astralcodexten.com/), both downstream and upstream of the tech billionaire ideology. I also read blogs like [boingboing.net](https://boingboing.net/), was a big fan of Cory Doctorow. I figured out I am trans in part because of [Thing of Things](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2017/05/05/the-cluster-structure-of-genderspace/), a blog by Ozy Frantz, a transmasc person in the broader rationalist and Effective Altruist blogosphere. One thing these all have in common is length. Part of the reason I only really got onto Twitter in 2020 or so was because the concept of microblogging, of having to fit your thoughts into such a small package, baffled me for ages. Amusingly I now think that being on Twitter and now Bluesky made me a better writer. [Restrictions breed creativity](https://articles.starcitygames.com/articles/restrictions-breed-creativity/), after all.

But through all of this I was never really satisfied with the options that were out there for long-form writing. Wordpress, even their hosted version, required a lot of setup to really be functional, Tumblr's system for comment/replies was and remains insane, hosting my own seemed like too much money to burn on something nobody might even read at the time, and honestly I felt like I kinda missed the boat on discoverability, as the internet grew larger and more centralised, with platforms like Substack eating what was left of the blogosphere. But at the same time, its success proves that there is very much a desire for long-form writing, enough that people will pay for it, and that investors will back it. There are thoughts and forms of writing that you simply cannot fit into a post or even a thread of posts, and which don't make sense on a topic-based forum, or a place like Archive of our Own. Plus, I'm loathe to enable a centralised platform like Substack where the owners are unfortunately friendly to fascists.

That's where the `at://` protocol and Weaver comes in.
### The pitch
Weaver is designed to be a highly flexible platform for medium and long-form writing on atproto. I was inspired by how weaver birds build their own homes, and by the notebooks, physical and virtual, that I create in the course of my work, to ideate, to document, and to inform. The initial proof-of-concept is essentially a static site generator, able to turn a Markdown text file or a folder of Markdown files, such as an Obsidian vault or git repository documentation, into a static "notebook" site. The file is uploaded to your PDS, where it can be accessed, either directly, via a minimal app server layer that provides a friendlier web address than an XRPC request or CDN link, or hosted on a platform of your choice, be that your own server or any other static site hosting service. The intermediate goal is an elegant and intuitive writing platform with collaborative editing and straightforward, immediate publishing via a web-app. The ultimate goal is to build a platform suitable for professional writers and journalists, an open alternative to platforms like Substack, with ways for readers to support writers, all on the AT protocol.

### So what about...
When I started working on Weaver back in the spring, the only real games in town for long-form blogging based on atproto, aside from rolling your own, [piss.beauty](https://piss.beauty) style, were [whtwnd.com](https://whtwnd.com/) and [leaflet.pub](https://leaflet.pub/home). Leaflet's good, and it's gotten a lot better in the last year, but it doesn't offer quite what I'm looking for either. For one, I am a Markdown fangirl, for better or for worse, and while Leaflet allows you to use Markdown for formatting, it doesn't speak it natively. There are [more alternatives now](https://connectedplaces.leaflet.pub/3m4qgpc7h3223), which makes sense as this space definitely feels like one that has gaps to fill. And the `at://` protocol, while it was developed in concert with a microblogging app, is actually pretty damn good for "macro"blogging, too. The interoperability the protocol allows is incredible. Weaver's app server can display Whitewind posts very easily. With some effort on my part, it can faithfully render Leaflet posts. It doesn't care what app your profile is on, it uses the [partial understanding](https://sdr-podcast.com/episodes/partial-understanding/) [capabilities](https://bsky.app/profile/nonbinary.computer/post/3m44ooo42xc2j) of the [jacquard](https://tangled.org/@nonbinary.computer/jacquard/) library I created to pull useful data out of it.
