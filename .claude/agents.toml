# Project Subagents Configuration
# Domain-specific agents for working on different parts of the codebase.
#
# When working on a specific domain, spawn a Task with subagent_type="Explore" or
# "general-purpose" and include the relevant agent's context in the prompt.
#
# Customize this file for YOUR project's structure. The domains below are examples.

# Example: Backend/Core agent
# [agents.backend]
# name = "Backend Agent"
# description = "API routes, database models, business logic"
# file_patterns = [
#     "src/**/*.rs",
#     "src/**/*.py",
#     "app/**/*.py"
# ]
# focus_areas = [
#     "Database operations",
#     "API endpoints",
#     "Business logic"
